## 🧭 Migration Journey: From Windows 11 → Ubuntu Linux  

In **September 2025**, I migrated from **Windows 11** to **Ubuntu Linux** to gain more **system control**, **security transparency**, and **privacy resilience**.  
Windows was a good start, but Ubuntu gave me **root access to knowledge** — the freedom to understand and secure every component of my machine.

### 🧩 Key Reasons for Migrating:
- Full control over system processes  
- Better privacy and data protection  
- Access to open-source cybersecurity tools  
- CLI-based precision for automation and monitoring

```bash

sudo usermod -aG sudo success
